## Hi there, we are Fobnail Team ðŸ‘‹

The Fobnail project provides the resources to create an axiomatically
trustworthy device and a simple user interface to confirm the status of the
platform. We aim to provide a reference architecture for building
offline integrity measurement verifiers on a USB device and validators running
in dynamically run measured environments (DLME).

Our goal is to create a scalable, flexible implementation that will be the main
building block of future (community) security. The owner of Fobnail can verify
the reliability of the working system before performing any sensitive operation.

We are using nRF52840 Dongle for a reference implementation of
[the Fobnail Token](https://fobnail.3mdeb.com/fobnail_token/), to which we
upload the Fobnail firmware prepared by us.

The Fobnail project has the potential to scale up in the future. The Fobnail
architecture can be adapted to devices using other buses than USB.

Fobnail is developed by [3mdeb](https://github.com/3mdeb).
A detailed description of the project can be found
[here](https://fobnail.3mdeb.com/).

## Community importance

We believe that a friendly community and cooperation are key to building
open-source trustworthy solutions. Because of that, we would like to invite you
to:

* [Fobnail Matrix Community](https://matrix.to/#/#fobnail:matrix.org) - where we
  want to discuss Fobnail, open-source projects and another security mechanism.
